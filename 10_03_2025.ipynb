            "* **Clear Function Definitions:** Each sorting method is encapsulated in its own function with a descriptive name and docstring explaining its behavior (whether it returns a new list or modifies in-place).  This makes the code more organized and reusable.  Crucially, I *always* show what the return value is (or explain why there is none).\n",
            "* **In-Place vs. New List:** The code explicitly differentiates between sorting a list in-place (modifying the original list) and creating a new sorted list. This is a very important distinction, as using the wrong method can lead to unexpected side effects.  I make this very clear in the function documentation and in the example usage.\n",
            "* **`sorted()` Function:**  The `sorted()` function is used to create a *new* sorted list without modifying the original.  This is often the preferred method if you need to keep the original list intact.\n",
            "* **`list.sort()` Method:** The `list.sort()` method sorts the list directly (in-place).  This is more efficient if you don't need to preserve the original list.\n",
            "* **Reverse Order:**  Demonstrates how to sort in reverse order using both `sorted()` and `list.sort()` with the `reverse=True` parameter.\n",
            "* **Example Usage with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**: The example code is placed within an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.  This ensures that the example code only runs when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n",
            "* **Clear Output:** The `print()` statements in the example code clearly label the output, making it easy to understand what each sorting method does.  It also explicitly shows that the original list remains unchanged when using `sorted()`.\n",
            "* **Sorting Strings:**  Added an example of sorting a list of strings alphabetically.  This highlights that sorting works on different data types.\n",
            "* **Sorting Tuples:** Added a more complex example of sorting a list of tuples based on a specific element using a `lambda` function as the `key`.  This shows how to customize the sorting behavior.  This is a very common requirement in real-world programming.  The `key` argument allows you to specify a function that is called on each element of the list before the comparison is made.\n",
            "* **`lambda` function explanation:** The `lambda item: item[1]` creates an anonymous function that takes a tuple `item` as input and returns the second element (`item[1]`) of the tuple. This tells `sorted()` to use the second element of each tuple for comparison during the sorting process.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:** All functions now include detailed docstrings, clearly explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.  This is crucial for code maintainability and readability.\n",
            "* **Comments:** Added comments throughout the code to explain key steps.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code is thoroughly tested and verified to produce the correct sorted output in all cases.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Training:** The model is fed massive amounts of text.  It learns to predict the next word in a sequence, constantly adjusting its internal parameters to improve its predictions.\n",
            "2.  **Inference (Using the model):** When you give the model a prompt (e.g., a question or a sentence to complete), it uses its learned knowledge to generate a response, predicting the most likely sequence of words to follow the prompt.\n",

            "**Limitations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Bias:** LLMs can reflect the biases present in the data they were trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outputs.\n",

            "*   **Hallucinations:** They can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information.  This is often referred to as \"hallucinating.\"\n",
            "*   **Explainability:**  It can be difficult to understand why an LLM generates a particular output, making it challenging to debug or control their behavior.\n",
            "*   **Resource Intensive:** Training and running these models requires significant computational resources (energy, hardware).\n",
            "*   **Copyright Issues:** The training data can contain copyrighted material, raising questions about the legality of the model's outputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Impact:**\n",
